## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is the first time I have used just HTML5 markup and CSS to create an accordion menu versus using Javascript. It was exciting to research about and learn how powerful HTML5 details and summary tags are, as well as how to customize the expand/collapse icons.

### Useful resources

- [CSSTricks](https://css-tricks.com/two-issues-styling-the-details-element-and-how-to-solve-them/) - This article helped me become familiar with the HTML5 details and summary tags.
- [NEWBEDEV](https://newbedev.com/replace-the-expand-icon-of-html5-details-tag) - This was an excellent resource about how to replace the expand icon of the HTML5 details tag.
